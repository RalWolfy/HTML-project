<h1> <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language"> HTML </abbr> </h1>
<p> HTML is a very frendly language and is on good terms with almost all of the web browsers. HTML is a form of <b> markup </b> aimed at presenting text documents on a single page using specialized rendering software called an HTML user agent, the best example of such software being the web browser. It is the least complicated when it comes to search engines. </p>

<div id="why">
<h2> Why isn't HTML a programming language? </h2>
<p> It controls the presentation, structure and layout of the data on a webpage. It just does not contain any functional or programming logic. <strong> Manipulating data is not in its nature</strong>, event handling, taking input and displaying output. <i> <b>It just does not contain any functional or programming logic. </b> </i> </p>
<details> <summary> If you dont't understand I can give you a more exactly discription </summary>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is a markup language, not a programming language. Why? Here we go. HTML along with XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or XHTML (eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language) and SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) do not describe algorithms, but information, the commands being executed by the browser not by <u> <abbr title="the language programming is executed by processor">the processor</abbr></u>. HTML is used to create web pages that can be displayed in a browser. The purpose of HTML is to present information -paragraphs, fonts, tables and so on- rather than to describe the semantics of the document. HTML contains data, organized just like a pdf, word, or a image, which also contains data. If HTML it's a programming language, then this <u> <abbr title="pdf, img, word"> documents </abbr> </u> are also programming languages, which is totaly wrong. Even tags, for exemple, are data, more exactly, metadata. I give you a few definition to understand. 
<dl> <dt> What is a programming language? </dt> <dd> A programming language is a valid set of expressions and rules (or techniques) for formulating instructions for a "computer". A programming language has a defined set of semantic and syntactic rules. It allows the programmer to specify exactly and announced actions that the computer must perform, in order with data. The specification basically consists in drawing up/writing the necesary programs (programming). </dd> <dt> What is metadata? </dt> <dd> Metadata are data who describe other data, such as paragraphs. A colection of data. </dd> </dl> </details> 
<p> An HTML ducument consists 2 imporatnt parts:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li> <strong> <u> <abbr title="what users will see"> Document Creation </abbr> </u> </strong> </li> <li> <strong> <u> <abbr title="how they see it"> Tags </abbr> </u> </strong> </li> </ul> 
</div>
<div id="tags">
<h2> Important tags </h2>
<p> Tag &nbsp;&lt;html&gt;&nbsp; is considered to be the <b> head of the family</b>. It's from this tag that the browser recognizes, it's an HTML ducument. The tag &nbsp;&lt;html&gt;&nbsp; is followed by the &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&nbsp; tag. This is a special one, because the content inside is not dispayed on the webpage. The &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&nbsp; tag is followed by the &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;&nbsp; tag, where the actual content is visible on the webpage. </p>
</div>
<div id="how">
<h2> How do Web Browsers interact with HTML? </h2>
<p> Browsers cannot/do not read the content directly from the place where it is stored. To settle this conflict, web servers are used. </p>
<dl> <dt> Web Servers </dt> <dd> A web server acts like an intermediator, it patiently listens to the browser's request and executes it for us. </dd> </dl>
