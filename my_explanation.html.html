<p> <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language"> <span id="htmlDD"><b>HTML</b></span> </abbr> is a markup language, and here I was repeating ,because this language it's often confused with a <span id="langprogram"><strong>programming language</strong></span>, but it's not. Now, you don't understand why this it's not a programming language. Let me explain. HTML along with XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or XHTML (eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language) and SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) do not describe algorithms, but information, the commands being executed by the browser not by the processor (The language programming is executed by processor). HTML is used to create web pages that can  be displayed in a browser. The purpose of HTML is to present information -paragraphs, fonts, tables and so on- rather than to describe the semantics of the document. HTML contains data, organized just like a pdf, word, or a image, which also contains data. If HTML it's a programming language, then this documents are also programming languages, which is totaly wrong. Even tags, for exemple, &#60;p&#62; are data, more exactly, <span id="MData"><strong>metadata</strong></span>. Yes, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;p&gt; are metadata. I give you a few definition to understand. </p>

<dt> <a href="#htmlDD">What is HTML? </a> </dt>
<dd> HTML is a form of markup aimed at presenting text documents on a single page using specialized rendering software called an HTML user agent, the best example of such software being the web browser. </dd>
<dt> <a href="#langprogram"> What is a programming language? </a> </dt>
<dd> A programming language is a valid set of expressions and rules (or techniques) for formulating instructions for a "computer". A programming language has a defined set of semantic and syntactic rules. It allows the programmer to specify exactly and announced actions that the computer must perform, in order with data. The specification basically consists in drawing up\writing the necesary programs (programming). </dd>
<dt> <a href="#MData"> What is metadata? </a> </dt>
<dd> Metadata are data who describe other data, such as paragraphs. A colection of data. ( &lt;p&gt; ) that are data that presents other data. </dd>
