<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<strong> Well</strong>, this was not <u> my first first code in HTML</u>, it was the <b> third </b>, and the true start up. You know how they say: <cite> The third time is lucky </cite>. Although from my point of view, some people take this very seriously, and expect those who make the mistake for the third time not to do it again. We are imperfect, everyone learns as he can, and as he knows best. </p>
<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe first program I was learning at school, at the <title="Information and Communication Technology"> TIC</title>. Right before the covid pandemic, we started learning about html. I started online, where the teacher of the subject could no longer contact us (I don't think she felt like doing anything with us anymore or she probably thinks that we have learned enough for the national assessment or maybe she taught us all the concepts that required the syllabus, although <em> in my opinion </em> there were still quite a few notions, and even important ones, only that there are students who do not like the syllabus). At one point he gave us a theme - to make frames that would be colored. Of course, I dedicated my time, as I dedicated myself for the other subjects, regardless of the fact that I had the national exam for the 8th grade. The homework had to be done something like this. </p>
